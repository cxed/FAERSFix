FAERSFix
========

![alt text](./fix.jpg "What a mess!")

This GitHub repository is a back up of my FAERSFix scripts. 

The
[FDA Adverse Event Reporting System](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm082193.htm)
is a horrifically dysfunctional quagmire of shockingly bad data. The
data is not just bad for severe epistemological reasons, it is also
poorly organized and riddled with flagrant absurd errors.

These scripts smooth over the very messy process of acquiring and
basic debugging of the data. At the end of the process a user can
arrive at a local repository of the FAERS data that is sane enough to
begin to think about some kind of sensible analysis. To understand the
disastrous state of the original source data, see the source code of
the scripts which is designed to be a readable self-documenting manual
demonstrating how to correct this mess.

Since the FDA's gremlins never rest, these scripts will become
obsolete. If you would like to contribute updates or fixes, feel free
to send me a patch or a pull request. Good luck!
